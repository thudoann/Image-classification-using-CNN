# Image classification using CNN

In this project, we aim to construct a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Vehicle Detection. The steps involved include selecting an appropriate CNN architecture, preventing overfitting with data augmentation, utilizing VGG-16 with Transfer Learning (a pre-trained CNN from the ImageNet competition), and examining the features learned during the process.
